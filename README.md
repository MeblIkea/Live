Unofficial Ableton Live Python Documentation for Surface Control for better completion.<br>
*Works for Live 11 and 12 (all editions and subversions)*

---
## How to use it?

This was made so when you're working on surface controls for Ableton, you can get a better idea of what is going on with IntelliSense.

Simply download this repo, and put it in your project like:
```
YourSurfaceControl
|- __init__.py
|- Live
  |- *
```

You should also include it in your `.gitignore` file (just add `Live` to the `.gitignore` file).

## More informations
For a better completion, you should also install [_Framework](https://github.com/gluon/AbletonLive12_MIDIRemoteScripts/tree/main/_Framework) and [ableton v2 and v3 scripts](https://github.com/gluon/AbletonLive12_MIDIRemoteScripts/tree/main/ableton) in your surface control project.<br>
AI such as GitHub Copilot was used to help with completing faster (even though it was doing it wrong most of the time).<br>
